- Restaurants and supplies can be registered
- It should be possible to view information for a supply
- A list of intens to be won every week for each of the restaurants must be generated.
- The list of items to be due must be sent to the Responsible's email

## Main resources used
- Elixir linter
- Migrations

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
